# QuizHut
 
QuizHut is a desktop application that has general questions related to modules in our degree 
program. There are multiple-choice questions that are in the app divided according to the 
modules. Any student in the university, can sign in for the system and can do the questions. 
Every one is not getting the questions in the same order. The order is changing. After doing the 
quiz, you can see how many of the questions you did are correct. And also users can see who 
is best on the selected module. The application helps the user to increase his/her knowledge.
